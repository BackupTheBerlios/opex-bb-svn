When editing the sources of Jilian or writing additionaly classes, modules or
patches we would recommend you to accord to some coding-conventions we have:

 - have a look at the comments, we didn't wrote them for fun :)
 - Please use the GNU-Styling to format the code
 - Write comments in english or german

A "Module" is just a File with a class (you have to make an entry into you DB
then). You >have< to give it a function named "Run", which will be executed
in runtime. An example module will be added later to this project. Just write
it here :)

Please write in a PHP5-compatible coding-style, use visibility keywords and so
on, this will make code much more easier to read and understand.


<?php

class MyModule
{
	// add your custom variables here
	
	
	function __costruct()
	{
		// You should know, what to do here...
	}
	
	
	function __destruct()
	{
		// You should know, what to do here...
	}
	
	
	function Run()
	{
		// this stuff will be executed when calling the module
		phpinfo();
	}
	
	// add custom functions here
}

?>
