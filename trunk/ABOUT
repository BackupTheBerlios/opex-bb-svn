Jilian

The Codename Jilian for this project is derived from the Within Temptation-Song
with the same name. While thinking of a good project name, Dominic - one of the
developers - was listening to this track at this moment. The rest was easy for
that.

Jilian will be released under AGPLv3. This means sources are available for
everyone who wants to use this software. See file COPYING for more information
on that.
